# The Gap

Some efficiency gap explaining in context of
[Gill v. Whitford](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gill-v-whitford/).

[Original? paper on the efficiency gap](http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&context=public_law_and_legal_theory)
by Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos and Eric M. McGhee

"Our analysis begins with the premise that the goal of a partisan gerrymander is
to win as many seats as possible given a certain number of votes. To accomplish
this aim, a party must ensure that its votes translate into seats more
“efficiently” than do those of its opponent."

"The efficiency gap, then, is simply the difference between the parties’
respective wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes cast in the
election."

"Wasted votes include both “lost” votes (those cast for a losing candidate) and
“surplus votes” (those cast for a winning candidate but in excess of what she
needed to prevail)"

"At its core, it is nothing more than a tally of all the cracking and packing
decisions in a district plan."

## Data

* Data from the Secretary of State.
  * 2016 has state house district
    [32B missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_House_of_Representatives_District_32B_special_election,_2017).
  * [1998](http://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/1998-general-election-results/)
    saw Jess Ventura win under the reform party which makes Governor not a good
    proxy, and it means that the reform party had some people on other tickets.
    Proxy State Auditor.
  * 1996 saw Ross Perot run for President who got a lot of votes. Might be good
    to proxy US Senator race.

### Data processing

1. Processing: `drake -w data.workflow`

## Embed

This project is best used as a full, standalone page, or an embed. The best way
to embed the piece is with the following code:

```html
<div data-pym-src="http://static.startribune.com/projects/the-gap">Loading...</div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/1.1.2/pym.v1.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

## Development

### Install

The following are global prerequisites and may already be installed.

1. (on Mac) Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
   * (on Mac) `brew install node`
1. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): `npm install gulp -g`

The following should be performed for initial and each code update:

1. Install Node dependencies: `npm install`

### Local

To run a local web server that will auto-reload with
[Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/), watch for file changes and re-build:
`gulp develop`

### Directories and files

* `config.json`: Non-content config for application.
  * Use this to add non-local JS or CSS assets, such as from a CDN.
  * This can be overridden with a `config.custom.json` if there is a need to add
    configuration that should not be put into revision history.
* `content.json`: See _Content and copy_. This file is used to hold content
  values. If the project is hooked up to a Google Spreadsheet, you should not
  manually edit this file.
* `templates/`: Holds HTML-like templates. Any files in here will get run
  through [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) templating and passed values from
  `config.json`, `content.json`, and `package.json`.
  * `templates/index.ejs.html`: The default page for the application.
* `styles/`: Styles in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) syntax.
  * `styles/index.scss`: Main point of entry for styles.
  * `styles/_*.scss`: Any includes should be prefixed with an underscore.
* `app/`: Where JS logic goes. This supports ES6+ JS syntax with
  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and gets compiled with
  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
  * `app/index.js`: Main entry point of application.
* `assets/`: Various media files. This gets copied directly to build.
* `sources/`: Directory is for all non-data source material, such as wireframes
  or original images. Note that if there are materials that should not be made
  public, consider using Dropbox and make a note in this file about how to
  access.
* `lib/`: Modules used in building or other non-data tasks.
* `tests/`: Tests for app; see Testing section below.
* The rest of the files are for building or meta-information about the project.

### Content and copy

By default, content items can be managed in `content.json`. The values put in
here will be available in the templates in the `templates/` directory as the
`content` object. This can be a helpful way to separate out content from code.

#### Google Spreadsheets

If `config.json` has a `content.spreadsheetId` value specified, `content.json`
can be updated with information from a Google Spreadsheet.

Since getting this content may not be very speedy, this is not done during `gulp
develop`, so it requires a manual call: `gulp content`

##### Setting up

If you went through the [Striblab Generator](), then this is probably already
set up for you, but in case it is not.

Getting content from a Google Spreadsheet depends on a few configurations. You
need need a Google Account (such as a Gmail account) and a Google Developer API
Service Account that has read and write access to Google Sheets and Google
Drive. You should then set the following environment variables. You can store
these values in a [`.env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) file.

* `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_EMAIL`: This will be something like
  _XXXXXX@XXXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com_.
* `GOOGLE_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will be something pretty long, like _--BEGIN
  PRIVATE--XXXXX--END PRIVATE KEY--_

_TODO_ (Find some good instructions for using the Google Developer Console;
unfortunately its complex and changes often.)

You can then set up a new spreadsheet with the following command, updating the
email to use your Google Email. The Google Email you use will become the owner
of the document. Note that a Google Email is not always a `@gmail.com` account.

    gulp content:create --email XXXXX@gmail.com

You can then add collaborators to the spreadsheet with the following command.
Note that you can do this in the Google Spreadsheet as well.

    gulp content:share --email XXXXX@gmail.com

##### Spreadsheet format

If you are using Google Spreadsheets for content, the headers should be `Key`,
`Value`, `Type`, and `Notes`. It is important that these are there in that exact
way. It is suggested to freeze the header row in case someone changes the order
of the spreadsheet.

### Dependencies and modules

Depending on what libraries or dependencies you need to include there are a few
different ways to get those into the project.

* **JS**
  * Include it with `npm`.
    * For instance: `npm install --save awesome-lib`
    * This can then be included in the application, with something like:
      ```js
      import awesome from 'awesome-lib';
      awesome.radical();
      ```
  * For dependencies that are very common and are available through a trusted
    CDN, you can include it in `config.json`. Consider using the
    [StribLab static libs CDN](https://github.com/striblab/static-libs).
    * For instance:
      ```js
      "js": {
        "globals": [
          "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/1.1.2/pym.v1.min.js"
        ]
      }
      ```
    * In your application, make sure to add a comment like the following so that
      linters will know that the dependency is already loaded.
      ```js
      /* global Pym */
      ```
    * **IMPORTANT** Make sure to always use a specific version from a CDN; do
      not use _latest_ or something similar.
    * For testing, these need to be available and should be added to
      `tests/global.js`
  * For local modules that you have written yourself, you can use the ES6 module
    syntax.
    * For instance, say you have created a `utils.js` module file, just use a
      relative path to include it:
      ```js
      import utilsFn from './utils.js';
      let utils = utilsFn({});
      ```
* **CSS**
  * Include it with `npm`.
    * For instance: `npm install --save normalize-scss`
    * This can then be included in the application, with something like:
      ```css
      @import 'normalize-scss/sass/_normalize.scss';
      ```
  * For dependencies that are very common and are available through a trusted
    CDN, you can include it in `config.json`. Consider using the
    [StribLab static libs CDN](https://github.com/striblab/static-libs).
    * For instance:
      ```js
      "css": {
        "globals": [
          "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
        ]
      }
      ```
    * **IMPORTANT** Make sure to always use a specific version from a CDN; do
      not use _latest_ or something similar.

### Testing

Testing is run via [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). Fast, unit and
higher level testing will happen on build. You can run these test manually with
`gulp js:test` or `npm test`.

Acceptance testing (i.e. high level quality assurance) is done separately as
running headless Chrome takes more than a couple seconds. You will need a new
version of Chrome or Chrome Canary installed, then run `js:test:acceptance`.

_NOTE_: Acceptance test will fail until
[this fix](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/2618) is published.

_TODO_: Some basic automated, cross-browser testing would be very beneficial.
Unfortunately things like Browserstack are very expensive, and managing our own
servers to do this would be very expensive time-wise as well.

#### Embed testing

A manual test page is provided for looking at the piece embeded in another page.

1. Assumes you are running the development server with `gulp develop`
1. Run a local server for the test directory, such as `cd tests && python -m
   SimpleHTTPServer` or `http-server ./tests/`
1. In a browser, go to
   [http://localhost:8080/manual/embed.html](http://localhost:8080/manual/embed.html).

### Build

All parts are compiled into the `build/` folder. The default complete build can
be done with `gulp` or `gulp build`

## Publish and deploy

Deployment is setup for AWS S3. Set the following environment variables; they
can be set in a [.env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) file as well. For
further reading on setting up access, see
[Configureing the JS-SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/configuring-the-jssdk.html).

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* OR `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`
* OR `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`

To deploy, run `gulp deploy`. This will build and publish to the location
configured as `default` (see _Configuration_ below).

To deploy to the `production` location, for instance, simply use that flag like:
`gulp deploy --production`

A handy command is to use `gulp publish:open` to open the URL to that project.

### Configuration

Publishing is configured in the `config.json` file. The `publish` property can
have the following keys: `default`, `testing`, `staging`, and `production`. It
is suggested to use default in place of the `staging` as the default gets used
when no flag is specified (see below). Each key should correspond to an object
with `bucket`, `path`, and `url`. **IMPORTANT**: The `url` should be a fully
qualified URL that ends with a `/`. This URL will get inserted into some meta
tags on the page by default. For example:

```js
{
  "publish": {
    "default": {
      "bucket": "static.startribune.com",
      "path": "news/projects-staging/all/the-gap/",
      "url": "http://static.startribune.com/news/projects-staging/all/the-gap/"
    },
    "production": {
      "bucket": "static.startribune.com",
      "path": "news/projects/all/the-gap/",
      "url": "http://static.startribune.com/news/projects/all/the-gap/"
    }
  }
}
```

Using the flags `--testing`, `--staging`, or `--production` will switch context
for any relevant `publish` or `deploy` commands. Note that if the flag is not
configured, the `default` will be used.

### Publishing token

The publishing function, uses a token that helps ensure a name collision with
another project doesn't overwrite files unwittingly. The `publishToken` in
`config.json` is used as an identifier. This gets deployed to S3 and then
checked whenever publishing happens again. The `gulp publish` (run via `gulp
deploy`) will automatically create this token if it doesn't exist.

If you see an error message that states that the tokens do not match, make sure
that the location you are publishing to doesn't have a different project at it,
or converse with teammates or administrators about the issue.

### Styles and practices

Having a consistent style for code and similar aspects makes collaboration
easier. Though there is nothing that enforces these things, intentionally so,
spending some time to adhere to these styles will be beneficial in the long run.

* **JS**: Javascript is linted with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and defined in
  `.eslintrc`.
  * The defined style extends from
    [eslint:recommended](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/conf/eslint.json)
    but is more focal about single quotes for strings and using semicolons.
  * Install the following ESLint plugins for
    [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint),
    [Sublime Text](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint), or
    [others](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).
* **Styles**: SASS (and CSS) is linted with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
  and defined in `.styleintrc`.
  * The defined style extends from
    [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard)
    with a couple additions to how colors are defined.
  * Install the following stylelint plugins for
    [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint),
    [Sublime Text](https://github.com/kungfusheep/SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint),
    or [others](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/complementary-tools/).

Other good practices that are not encompassed with linters.

* **General**
  * Comment as much as possible without being overly redundant.
* **JS**
  * Use small modules as much as possible.
* **Styles**
  * Use `class`es instead of `id`s for HTML elements, specifically for styling
    and JS.
  * Use relative units such as `rem`, `em`, `vh`, `vw`, or `%`, instead of
    absolute values such as `px`. This helps accessibility as well as designing
    for different screen sizes.
    * Overall, use `rem` for "component" level styling, such as a form, and then
      use `em` for styling inside components.
